              33% of people experience brief periods of high stress everyday. At work, school, or at home. 
              This can manifest as hyperventilating, sweating, negative and racing thoughts, and restlessness. 
              With long wait times and expensive fees, long-term professional care is inaccessible to many. 
              In a survey we conducted, 41% of people said they are unaware when they are experiencing a 
              period of high stress or are about to have an anxiety attack. People also hesitate to reach
              out for help due to stigma and self-consciousness.

                The Grounded device consists of two wearables, made to be discreet and comfortable, that go on your feet. The device measures stress using biometric sensors, then prompts the user to use grounding techniques to help them calm down. It collects information such as heart rate and galvanic skin response and uses an ML model to predict if the user is stressed. Then, the device will notify them to use the app's guided breathing exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, and/or mindfulness activities. By connecting to the Grounded App, the user can monitor their biometric data in real-time and access the guided relaxation techniques.

                <p>We offer users two techniques to help them calm down when experiencing high stress:</p>
                <h5>1. Breathing visualizer</h5>
                <p>On the app, you can follow a visualizer that guides your breathing to slow down.</p>
                <h5>2. Bi-lateral Stimulation</h5>
                <p>BLS stands for Bi-Lateral Stimulation, which is a technique that uses tapping or vibrations on both sides of the body in a back-and-forth pattern. 
                  <a href="https://www.evolutionsbh.com/articles/how-bilateral-stimulation-can-help-you-feel-better/">Research</a> has found that this can help lower heart rate in a short amount of time, usually within 30 seconds to two minutes.</p>

We are now working on setting up the flask API for transmission of sensor data from the app to the stress prediction code. We were successful in sending the prediction results to the API.</p>

                <p>This week we are continuing to develop the app and Flask API. Now the API also provides the averaged BPM, IBI, and EDA values from the data provided. We are also working on a more efficient method for storing the raw sensor data in the app. Next steps are to start calibrating the sensors to be more accurate and setting up the final API calls and call them at regular intervals.</p>

                <p>Here's what we're working on for next week: </p>
                <ul class="a">
                  <li>Order parts, assemble and test the PCB.</li>
                  <li>More design iterations for the physical design to find an optimal, comfortable fit for all the sensors and components.</li>
                  <li>Calibrate pulse and skin conductance sensor to get accurate results.</li>
                  <li>Finish setting up API calls and have the prediction results updated at regular intervals.</li>
                </ul>
