                33% of people experience brief periods of high stress everyday.
                At work, school, or at home. This can manifest as
                hyperventilating, sweating, negative and racing thoughts, and
                restlessness. With long wait times and expensive fees, long-term
                professional care is inaccessible to many. In a survey we
                conducted, 41% of people said they are unaware when they are
                experiencing a period of high stress or are about to have an
                anxiety attack. People also hesitate to reach out for help due
                to stigma and self-consciousness.

          </header>
          <p>
            Our solution consists of two sock-like wearables. The devices
            auto-detects when the user is feeling stressed through biometric
            sensors and a machine learning model. When a high-stress is
            detected, the user is notified via the Grounded mobile app. The user
            can then choose from multiple grounding techniques such as
            Bi-lateral Stimulation and breathing exercises. With a slim,
            comfortable design, users can discretely manage their stress without
            feeling disrupted.

              <span class="icon solid major style1 fa-heartbeat"></span>
              <h3>Auto-recognition</h3>
              <p>
                The device uses a pulse sensor and galvanic skin response
                sensor. This data is sent to a machine learning model to
                accurately predict if the user is experiencing high or low
                stress.

              ></span>
              <h3>Fast relief</h3>
              <p>
                Bi-lateral stimulation uses vibration actuators to stimulate a
                calming, rhythmic pattern on both sides of the body. A breathing
                visualizer helps slow your heart rate.

              <h3>Discrete Design</h3>
              <p>
                The wearable is a sock that fits comfortably inside your shoe,
                making it completely invisible. With small, removable
                components, the device is design for everyday use.
