              For the physical design we are using a polyester-based sock (heat
              resistant and nonconductive material) as our base of the design
              and have a cut for the pulse sensor as well as the GSR sensor
              electrodes. The top strap (containing the electrical components)
              is removable and attached with Velcro to allow for the rest of the
              design to be washed. A rough prototype of the design has been made
              for both feet.

              To minimize on space we've designed a PCB for our main circuit.
              This week we ordered the surface mount electronic components and
              have started testing the circuit with simple wiring to ensure
              everything works.

              This week, we focused on connecting the main device via BLE
              (high-speed bluetooth) technology to the smartphone app. We were
              successful in polling and sending the sensor data to be displayed
              and stored on the app. We also built the stress prediction code by
              deploying and incorporating the previously trained ML model and
              building the data pipeline taking json file as input. We are now
              working on setting up the flask API for transmission of sensor
              data from the app to the stress prediction code. We were
              successful in sending the prediction results to the API.

          <h2>Here's what we're working on this week:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Finish designing both PCBs and place an order for all remaining
              components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modify the design to accommodate for the GSR sensors and ensure
              they are a tight fit in the design for sensor accuracy as well as
              working on finalizing connection of electrical components into the
              design.
            </li>
            <li>Continue working on the API to import data from the client.</li>
            <li>
              Find an optimal way to store the sensor data on the app and send
              it to the Flask backend for the prediction model.
            </li>
            <li>
              Start working on the controller code for the vibration motors.
