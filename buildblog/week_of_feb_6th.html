              The design was modified to include better fit for the sensors in
              the design for sensor accuracy. More material was purchased which
              is needed for this purpose and will be sewed into the design for
              the next design iteration.

              The PCB design was completed this week and the order has been sent
              out. Final components have also been ordered. Once everything
              arrives, the PCB will be tested and if any corrections are needed
              they will be made.

              This week we are continuing to develop the app and Flask API. Now
              the API also provides the averaged BPM, IBI, and EDA values from
              the data provided. We are also working on a more efficient method
              for storing the raw sensor data in the app. Next steps are to
              start calibrating the sensors to be more accurate and setting up
              the final API calls and call them at regular intervals.

            <li>Order parts, assemble and test the PCB.</li>

              More design iterations for the physical design to find an optimal,

              Calibrate pulse and skin conductance sensor to get accurate

            <li>
              Finish setting up API calls and have the prediction results
              updated at regular intervals.

            Grounded is a prototype project created for our Mechatronics Fourth
            Year Design Project. You can check us out at the 2023 Mechatronics
            Symposium.
