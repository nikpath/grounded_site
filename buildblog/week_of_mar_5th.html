              The design was modified for more comfort and a minimal feel and
              reassembled. The design was reversed so that the sensors sit
              inside the design in the same location as before and for comfort
              the circuit board position is moved near the battery which would
              be removable using Velcro. Everything sits inside the design, all
              electrical components were sewed and fixed into our design so
              outside, our solution is completely discreet.

              Assembled the PCB and tested the full circuit. Lots of
              troubleshooting to get the usb bridge working so we can upload
              code to the esp32 module. Continuing to troubleshoot issues with
              incorrect sensor values.

              Implemented the BLS code which turns on the vibration actuators on
              the two wearables in an alternating fashion. Finished the main
              functionality for the app so it polls the sensors, sends data to
              the API and returns/displays the predicted stress level. The app
              also now prompts the user to choose a grounding technique if they
              are stressed and the user can manually start the BLS system. More
              data was collected and the model was re-trained, also the data
              processing was moved to happen on the API side so that only the
              analog values need to be polled from the sensors.

          <h2>Here's what we're working on this week:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Re-design and order new PCB to solve sensor reading issues.</li>
            <li>Modify physical design for presentability and comfort.</li>
            <li>
              Clean up the UI to be more presentable and have a better UX flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implement filters/find a way to decrease the noise on the data due
              to the BLE. Re-train models

            Grounded is a prototype project created for our Mechatronics Fourth
            Year Design Project. You can check us out at the 2023 Mechatronics
            Symposium.
